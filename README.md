# School_District_Analysis

Analysis of school district data for Maria and her supervisor, using Pandas and Numpy in Jupyter Notebook (Python).

# Challenge

After meeting with Maria and the school superintendent, I have decided the best action is to:
  1. Replace the ninth-grade math and reading scores from Thomas High School.
  2. Keep all other data associated with the ninth-grade students and Thomas High School intact.
  
## District Summary

After recalculating the district summary DataFrame, the total number of schools, students, etc., remain unchanged. This is good, as we didn't want these to change. All grade scores and pass percentages have fallen.
